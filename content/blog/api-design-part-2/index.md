This blog post is part 2 of this post.

It took me almost a year to get to the sequel for this ðŸ˜„.

My primary struggle was to come up with a problem statement to tackle.

It's kinda hard to get the Goldilocks version of anything and this post doesnâ€™t seem to be the exception.

Anyway, let's dig into it.

I decided to go with creating a sample API for a fictional Food Delivery App

Let's list out the requirements:

- The consumer should be able to order from only one restaurant for a session.

- The consumer can add one item at a time. Like clicking on (+).

- The consumer should be able to provide the desired quantity for a particular item.

- The consumer should be able to generate an invoice for a final order.

- The consumer should be able to format the invoice in either HTML or text format (stretch goal)
